This project demonstrates three core tasks in data mining.
1.Classification using decision trees
2.Cluster analysis
3.Text mining

Task 1 involves loading and inspecting datasets,applying one-hot encoding.
Training a Decision Tree Classifier and computing its training error rate.

Task 2 carries out cluster analysis, applying K-Means and clustering.

Task 3 predicts tweet sentiment analysis using Natuaral Language Processing(NLP)
Involves Tokenize,Stemming,Term Document matrix and training a Naive Bayes Classifier.
